# YOURLS Anonymise Plugin

This plugin stops [YOURLS](http://yourls.org) recording users' IP addresses and user-agents. Since IPs aren't collected, neither are country codes.

It'll somewhat diminish the amount of data in your analytics, but click counts, dates, and referrers are maintained.

A very full-on way to avoid handling personal data.
